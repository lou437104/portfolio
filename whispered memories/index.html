    <h2>About Whispered Memories</h2>
    <p>Whispered Memories began as a personal healing journey. After losing my dad to sepsis three years ago, I found comfort in drawing tributes that celebrated his life. What started as one drawing has grown into a mission‚Äîto honour those we‚Äôve loved and lost through meaningful, custom artwork. All profits go to The sepsis Trust UK and The max & George Trust in his memory.</p>
    <p>My name is Louise Guest, and I am the artist behind Whispered Memories. I believe that art can be a powerful tool for remembrance and healing. Each piece I create is infused with love, care, and a deep respect for the memories we hold dear.</p>
    <p>If you‚Äôre looking for a digital illustration tribute, I‚Äôm here to help you celebrate the life of your loved one. Every piece is unique and tailored to reflect their spirit and essence.</p>
    <p>Thank you for considering Whispered Memories. I look forward to creating something special for you.</p>
    <p>With love, Louise</p>

    <h4>Dads story</h4>

    <P>Three years ago, my world changed forever.
      I lost my dad to sepsis ‚Äî suddenly, painfully, and without warning. One moment he was here, and the next‚Ä¶ everything was quiet. The kind of quiet that hurts. The kind of quiet that never really goes away.
      </P>
    <p>In March of 2022 my dad fell ill severely ill with covid he spends weeks in hospital after weeks in hospital he was released over the coming months leading up to his death dad became sicker by the day he was having community nurses coming out to him everyday on the 26th June thanks to an off duty paramedic who saw the signs of Sepsis she had him rushed into hospital he spent 10 days in hospital and sadly passed away on the 8th of July due to Sepsis </p>
    <p>He wasn‚Äôt just my dad. He was my safe place. The person who made the world feel softer when everything else felt too loud. He always knew what to say. He saw me ‚Äî truly saw me ‚Äî and loved me without conditions.</p>
    <p>After he passed, I didn‚Äôt know what to do with the grief.
      It sat heavy on my chest, silent and sharp.
      So I started to draw ‚Äî at first, just to breathe again. Just to feel him close.
      </p>
    <p>That one drawing turned into something I never expected.
      It became Whispered Memories ‚Äî a space where love doesn‚Äôt disappear when someone is gone. A space where we can honour those we miss, not with sadness alone, but with light, colour, and meaning.
      </p>
    <p>This project exists because of him.
      Because he believed in me, even when I didn‚Äôt.
      Because I still hear his voice when I draw ‚Äî soft, steady, proud.</p>
    <p>I miss him every single day.
      But through this work, I feel him with me.
      Still guiding. Still loving. Still here.</p>
