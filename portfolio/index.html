            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Louise Guest, and I am 21 years old and i am a learning support assisstant at a secondary school when i am not working i enjoy learning web development and would like to become an full time web developer.  </p>
            <p>every project ive done is all self taught as it currently stands i do not have any sort of degree or qaulification in this field <strong>however</strong>i am constantly coding mini projects in my free time and learning web development that way and i am also completing the certified full stack developer course on free code camp and i am also completing the frontend developer career path on scrimba</p>
            <p>FreeCodeCamp is giving me a structured foundation in full-stack development. I'm learning front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end concepts like Node.js, databases, and APIs. Their hands-on projects that help me apply what I learn in real-world scenarios, making my portfolio stronger.</p>
            <p> Scrimba, on the other hand, is helping me level up my front-end skills with interactive lessons. I'm refining my understanding of React, JavaScript ES6, and modern web development practices. The interactive coding environment lets me practice directly within the platform, reinforcing concepts in a way that sticks.</p>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites.</p>
            <p>I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a bit of python and I am excited to share my projects with you.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy :
                <ul>
